### Challenge
To promote and advance the use of synthetic data for face recognition, we organize the **Face Recognition Challenge in the Era of Synthetic Data (FRCSyn)**. This challenge intends to provide an in-depth analysis of the following research questions:

- What are the limits of face recognition technology trained only with synthetic data?
- Can the use of synthetic data be beneficial to reduce the current limitations existed in face recognition technology?

Face recognition technology raises significant **privacy concerns**, has several limitations in terms of **bias in demographic groups** (e.g., ethnicity and gender), and lack of performance in **challenging conditions** such as large age gaps between enrolment and testing, pose variations, occlusions, etc. 

Here we show a few examples of synthetic identities and the intra-class variation provided by FRCSyn for training face recognition systems:

The challenge's results will analyze **improvements achieved using synthetic data** and the state-of-the-art face recognition technology **in realistic scenarios**, providing valuable contributions to advance the field.
