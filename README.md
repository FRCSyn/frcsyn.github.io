# Challenge
To promote and advance the use of synthetic data for face recognition, we organize the Face Recognition Challenge in the Era of Synthetic Data (FRCSyn). This challenge intends to provide an in-depth analysis of the following research questions:

- What are the limits of face recognition technology trained only with synthetic data?
- Can the use of synthetic data be beneficial to solve/reduce the current limitations existed in face recognition technology?

Face recognition technology raises significant privacy concerns, has several limitations in terms of bias in demographic groups (e.g., ethnicity and gender), and lack of performance in challenging conditions such as large age gaps between enrolment and testing, pose variations, occlusions, etc.

The results achieved in the proposed challenge will allow to analyse in detail the improvements achieved while using synthetic data and the state-of-the-art performance of current face recognition technology in realistic operational scenarios, extracting very valuable contributions to advance in the field.
